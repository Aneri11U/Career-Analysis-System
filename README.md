# Career-Analysis-System

In our code first we do registration of user if already not registered. The registration of user will be saved in File.txt which we made using File handling through which multiple user can register. In registration we take information of student. For example Name, e-mail id, phone number, Address etc. Then user will set their username and password. Then user have to login with username and password.
After completion of registration and login students have to provide their educational background through which we suggest Career options. First of all we ask students if they are in School or College. If student is in School we suggest career options after school. If student is in college we suggest career options after college.

If students are clear about their goal then we suggest the roadmap of the field accordingly. We give many career options to users. Like Engineer, Doctor, Government servant, Army, CA, etc. We ask user to choose their favorite field. We provide roadmap for that field. And We give information about top colleges.

But there are students who canâ€™t decide their goal. For them we conduct a quiz which can suggest field. In quiz we give questions of personality and logic. By their personality and logical thinking we suggest few fields.
